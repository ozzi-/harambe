<h2>Gorilla Warfare</h2>
Welcome to Gorilla Warfare [GW] !<br>
We are a bunch of people and robots who play video games.<br><br>
Such as: 
<ul>
	<li>Insurgency</li>
	<li>Squad</li>
	<li>Rainbow Six Siege</li>
	<li>Age of Empires 2</li>
	<li>Overwatch</li>
	<li>Rocket League</li>
	<li>And many more</li>
</ul>
<br>
We consider ourselves a 'fun' clan, no serious <i>hardcore mlg gaming</i>.<br>
Just people who like to play with other people. Although some of us also enjoy competitive gameplay from time to time.<br>
